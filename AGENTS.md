# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `app/` contains the Hono/Honox application code (routes, components, domains).
- `app/routes/` holds page and MDX content; locale content lives under `app/routes/ja/`.
- `app/components/`, `app/islands/`, and `app/domains/` group UI pieces, client islands, and domain helpers.
- `public/` stores static assets served as-is (images, icons).
- `materials/` contains source assets used to generate files in `public/`.
- `dist/` is the build output generated by Vite.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite dev server for local development.
- `npm run build`: build both client and server bundles (creates `dist/`).
- `npm run preview`: run Cloudflare Pages preview with Wrangler.
- `npm run deploy`: build then deploy to Cloudflare Pages.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Use 2-space indentation and double quotes in TypeScript/TSX (see `app/`).
- Prefer named exports for components and utilities.
- Keep file names in `app/routes/` aligned with route paths (e.g., `app/routes/ja/index.tsx`).
- Formatting is handled by Prettier with `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`; run Prettier if you touch Tailwind class strings.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test runner is configured in this repo.
- Validate changes by running `npm run dev` and spot-checking pages locally.
- For production parity, use `npm run preview` before deployment.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow short, imperative commit messages (examples in history: “Add …”, “Update …”, “Fix …”).
- Keep commits scoped to a single topic when possible.
- PRs should include a concise description, the user-facing impact, and screenshots for UI changes.
- Link related issues or discussions when applicable.

## Configuration & Deployment Notes
- Cloudflare Pages settings live in `wrangler.toml`.
- Vite configuration is in `vite.config.ts`; Tailwind is in `tailwind.config.js`.
